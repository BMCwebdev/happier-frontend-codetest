# Happier Front-end Developer Test

This repository is the code for the Happier Front-end Developer Test. This is a simple one-page AngularJS app that is loading 3 videos in an ng-repeat.  The videos aren't working.  All you have to do is make them work. If you've done it before, the solution could take 10 minutes, but we expect that it will take up to a couple of hours to solve.
