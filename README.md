# Happier Front-end Developer Test

This repository is the code for the Happier Front-end Developer Test. This is a simple one-page AngularJS app that is loading 3 videos in an ng-repeat.  The videos aren't working.  All you have to do is make them work. If you've done it before, the solution could take 10 minutes, but we expect that it will take up to a couple of hours to solve. 

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-seed repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the happier-codetest repository. You can get it from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize the test. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone happier-codetest

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git
cd happier-codetest
```

### Install Dependencies

To setup the project, first run:

```

```

To start the project, run:

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
